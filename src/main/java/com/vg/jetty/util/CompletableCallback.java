/**
 * A callback to be used by driver code that needs to know whether the callback has been
 * succeeded or failed (that is, completed) just after the asynchronous operation or not,
 * typically because further processing depends on the callback being completed.
 * The driver code competes with the asynchronous operation to complete the callback.
 * <p />
 * If the callback is already completed, the driver code continues the processing,
 * otherwise it suspends it. If it is suspended, the callback will be completed some time
 * later, and {@link #resume()} or {@link #abort(Throwable)} will be called to allow the
 * application to resume the processing.
 * <p />
 * Typical usage:
 * <pre>
 * CompletableCallback callback = new CompletableCallback()
 * {
 *     &#64;Override
 *     public void resume()
 *     {
 *         // continue processing
 *     }
 *
 *     &#64;Override
 *     public void abort(Throwable failure)
 *     {
 *         // abort processing
 *     }
 * }
 * asyncOperation(callback);
 * boolean completed = callback.tryComplete();
 * if (completed)
 *     // suspend processing, async operation not done yet
 * else
 *     // continue processing, async operation already done
 * </pre>
